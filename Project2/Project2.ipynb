    "- The **modeling** of the problem as an evolutionary problem (chromosomes, genes, etc);\n",
    "- How to **generate the initial population**;\n",
    "- The chosen **fitness function**;\n",
    "- How to **visualize** the result.\n",

    "- Stop criteria;\n",
    "- Selection technique;\n",
    "- Crossover technique;\n",
    "- Mutation technique;\n",

    "## **Problem**\n",
    "### General Information\n",
    "The problem consists of, given the original image, recreating an image from scratch. The original is only used for fitness purposes (how good is the image generated). This is not particularly useful in many applications, but can be used as basis for other problems, and is good for the purpose of this project: test different methods of reproduction, mutation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation came from [Roger Johansson's \"Evolution of Mona Lisa\"](https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/), but instead of using polygons, the pixel values are directly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling\n",
    "The modeling of the problem as a GA problem is almost direct: the image is the individual (chromosome) and each of its pixels is a gene. The image can be represented by a multitude of different ways. The chosen way of representation is as a flat array, as this allows for easier operations, especially crossover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "Due to the huge number of combinations in a regular RGB image ($255^3$ possiblities per pixel), greyscale images are used in this project. High resolution images were rescaled to a lower resolution using *OpenCV* as some images would simply take too long to test."

    "The code was organized in such a manner which allows us to first define every method used as well as discuss them in separated modules, making each part more readable and comprehesible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to merge all components of the code, we created a class called GeneticAlgorithm. This class retains some essential variables for the methods defined along the report. To allow such methods to access these variables (even though they are not a part of the class) nearly every method must receive as it's **first parameter the class instance** which is referred as the **parameter 'self' in the method's definitions**. It should also be noted that the method usualy have no return statements, simply because the 'self' parameter is a reference to the class instance, which **allow the methods to make changes in-place**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify which class variables are necessary/used and which are defined/altered by the methods in each section, there will be a list of **used class variables** and **defined class variables** within the description of every section. On top of these uses and definitions, there are parameters which are method dependent, these are in the sections **necessary parameters**."

    " 1. *self.goal* - The flattened image, which is an array containing the input image pixels. \n",

Assume we have the best indivudual so far ($B$), therefore, we can estimate when the algorithm is decreasing it's evolution rate (or improvement rate) by checking how many generations have passed since $B$ was achieved: the more generations where $B$ wasn't improved, the more likely is that the algorithm has converged. The convergence method defined in this section is based on this idea.\n",

    " - A method of Uniform Crossover was implemented initially, to contrast with the k-point crossover. It was extremely slow since it had to iterate through every gene (and there are a lot of genes) and randomize the possibility of gene exchange. Despite being a possible counter measure to premature convergence, it was simply to slow to use.\n",
    " - Rergarding mutation rate and mutation ammount, in our case it appeared to be better when we would use the a higher probability of mutation with a smaller number of genes to mutate. The more genes we mutate, the slower is the iteration (as we need to roll the dice more times), so a higher change of mutation was a more efficient approach agains a higher number of genes to mutate.\n",
    " - Different sizes of populations did not seem to interfere significantly with the results, as expected a smaller population converges faster but it alsos converges prematurely most times.\n",
    " - We've noted that the elitism replacement method was killing the diversity within our population. This observation was done through the average fitness of each generation: with this value we were able to note that the average fitness was always equal to the best fit so far. So there was the need to wait for a mutation to insert some diversity in the population. Changing the the replacement method was helpful to create diversity and improve the convergence rate."

In later generations this reduced diversity might cause a halt in the convergence process. This method takes more time per iteration without a significant gain in convergence speed, which lead us to choose the reduced mutation instead."

    "##### Elitism Replacement\n",
    "This method of replacement has a step convergence curve, at leas at first. Shortly after the intial fitness drop, we can see in the fitness curve the premature convergence of the population: the curve becomes almost a horizontal line. It's also noticeable how the diversity of the population is decimated, which contributes to the premature convergence. For these reasons, steady replacement presented itself as a more promising method of replacement."

    "### Qualitative Analysis\n",
    "Overall, the best results achieved for the small images were of good quality and high similarity. In some cases, it was possible to considerably reduce the fitness value to quite low values. Some of the final results and their original versions can be seen below. With the big images, it was possible to achieve results that resemble the original, with a lot of noise. In the image 'objetos.png', for example, the noise filled most of the white space in the picture, even (but less so) when a white image is used as starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two major problems that this project ran into were, in one hand, **premature convergence**, and on the other hand, **slow convergence speed**. Sometimes, both of these problems were present at once, when a lot of iterations were needed to keep optimizing the fitness value, and the convergence speed slowed down with still a high error value.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted previously, the first problem was made better by adding exponential transfer to the roulette selection. While that made the small images converge a lot better, the larger images still ended up with slowdowns after a few hundreds of thousands of iterations. The image was still improving regularly, but not as fast as needed to achieve the desired result, since the error was still in the tens of millions. This leads to the second problem. The balancing act brought the project to its current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem not related to convergence, however, is the slow iteration speed. This happens due to the amount of heavy operations in the code, such as the squared error and MSE calculations, and multiple instances of random number generation, be it with _NumPy_ arrays or regular lists. For these reasons, an iteration can be slow depending on the size of the input and the machine running the tests. The speed was improved with tweaks in different methods, avoiding repetition of calculations and using faster variations, but larger images still suffer with it. Since the larger images are also the ones that require more generations to converge, this becomes a big problem, which couldn't be solved so far, only improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a good computer or using the Google Colab environment, it takes a few hours to run 5 million iterations on the larger images, with resolution reduction factor of 0.6. Since this problem wasn't solved so far, the best course of action is to avoid it, using higher reduction factors or smaller images. This also validates the decision to use greyscale images instead of RGB."

    "One interesting case to discuss is `objetos.png`. It is the second largest image to be used in this project. After reduction, the resulting image has 142x142 px dimensions, and the original has 238x238 px. The main difference with the content of this image is the amount of white space it contains, and the fact that it consists of 9 separated objects instead of a continuous figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result above was obtained after 271985 generations, using the `random` initialization strategy. Notice how noisy the image is, in the white space and inside the objects. A noticeable characteristic is that the lighter objects are not as clear as the harder ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that the amount of noise in the white space is hurting the fidelity of the result, and that would have to be cleared at some point. When, instead, we insert a white image in the original population, using the `white_and_random` function, the result is quite different. The result with a similar amount of generations can be seen below."

    "That image, while still noisy, is much more clear than the one before, because the white image already starts with a lot of correct pixels. The noise is a result of collateral damage by mutation and over-crossover: the result is still a net positive from the full white. \n",
    "\n",
    "But a problem that might arise from this case is the homogenization of a part of the image. If every individual comes from the white board, it is possible that every image has the bottom half as just white, especially using the `elitism` replacement method, since crossovers in the upper half are more valuable than the bottom half in terms of optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that, while most noise is in the upper half, there are some shades of grey in the bottom half as well, so this could be due to the multi-point crossover and steady state replacement method. In this case, the introduction of the white image made a big difference in convergence speed, and that is true for all images with a white background in this GA configuration. The best result for this image is shown below."

    "### General Conclusions\n",
    "As expected, the amount of possibilities makes this a hard problem to solve, especially for higher resolution images. The initial error values can be astronomical, and the optimization can be slow, even if regular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the results achieved with small images are really similar to the original, even in full resolution, so this project was a success in that front. With really small images, the a very similar result could be achieved in just a few thousand generations. Most of those images, though, reached minimum point after which there was no improvement found, even after hundreds of thousands of generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, along with the noisy result that the larger images returned, lead to the conclusion that the GA is not exactly copying the goal image, but getting \"close enough\" so that the characteristics of the original image are present, but not clear of noise or sometimes even whole. This inability of removing noise or getting an exact copy of the original image can be seen as a characteristic of GA, with random movements, crossover and mutation. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve an exact copy of the image, one individual has to at some point go through a perfect crossover+mutation process, where the last different pixel becomes the exact same shade as the original image and no other pixels are changed. Since the method is random, the chances of that happening are very slim."

    "\n",
    "Future work for this project would be to speed up each iteration so that larger images can be tested in appropriate times, and test different or more exotic methods of reproduction, mutation and others. In this project, the mutation rate (MR) was **static**, so a dynamic MR could lead to different results as well. This project can also be scaled to deal with colored images, especially if the aforementioned problems are solved."
