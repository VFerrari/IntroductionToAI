    "The project consists of a study of genetic algorithm-based solutions for **image reconstruction**. A few set aspects of the problem will be explained, implemented and discussed here, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **modeling** of the problem as an evolutionary problem (chromosomes, genes, etc);\n",
    "- How to **generate the initial population**;\n",
    "- The chosen **fitness function**;\n",
    "- How to **visualize** the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with that, some aspects of the genetic algorithm will be tested and discussed with multiple approaches, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stop criteria;\n",
    "- Selection technique;\n",
    "- Crossover technique;\n",
    "- Mutation technique;\n",
    "- Generation replacement method.\n",

    "## **Problem**\n",
    "### General Information\n",
    "The problem consists of, given the original image, recreating an image from scratch. The original is only used for fitness purposes (how good is the image generated). This is not particularly useful in many applications, but can be used as basis for other problems, and is good for the purpose of this project: test different methods of reproduction, mutation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation came from [Roger Johansson's \"Evolution of Mona Lisa\"](https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/), but instead of using polygons, the pixel values are directly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling\n",
    "The modeling of the problem as a GA problem is almost direct: the image is the individual (chromosome) and each of its pixels is a gene. The image can be represented by a multitude of different ways. The chosen way of representation is as a flat array, as this allows for easier operations, especially crossover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "Due to the huge number of combinations in a regular RGB image ($255^3$ possiblities per pixel), greyscale images are used in this project. High resolution images were rescaled to a lower resolution using *OpenCV* as some images would simply take too long to test."

    "The code was organized in such a manner which allows us to first define every method used as well as discuss them in separated modules, making each part more readable and comprehesible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to merge all components of the code, we created a class called GeneticAlgorithm. This class retains some essential variables for the methods defined along the report. To allow such methods to access these variables (even though they are not a part of the class) nearly every method must receive as it's **first parameter the class instance** which is referred as the **parameter 'self' in the method's definitions**. It should also be noted that the method usualy have no return statements, simply because the 'self' parameter is a reference to the class instance, which **allow the methods to make changes in-place**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify which class variables are necessary/used and which are defined/altered by the methods in each section, there will be a list of **used class variables** and **defined class variables** within the description of every section. On top of these uses and definitions, there are parameters which are method dependent, these are in the sections **necessary parameters**."

    "The read image is kept in two class variables: \n",
    " 1. *self.goal* - The flattened image, which is an array containing the input image pixels. \n",

Assume we have the best indivudual so far ($B$), therefore, we can estimate when the algorithm is decreasing it's evolution rate (or improvement rate) by checking how many generations have passed since $B$ was achieved: the more generations where $B$ wasn't improved, the more likely is that the algorithm has converged. The convergence method defined in this section is based on this idea.\n",

    "## **Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Uniform Crossover is extremely slow since it has to iterate through every gene (and there are a lot of genes) and randomize the possibility of gene exchange. Despite being a possible counter measure to premature convergence, it was simply to slow to use it.\n",
    " - Rergarding mutation rate and mutation ammount, in our case it appeared to be better when we would use the a higher probability of mutation with a smaller number of genes to mutate. The more genes we mutate, the slower is the iteration (as we need to roll the dice more times), so a higher change of mutation was a more efficient approach agains a higher number of genes to mutate.\n",
    " - Different sizes of populations did not seem to interfere significantly with the results, as expected a smaller population converges faster but it alsos converges prematurely most times.\n",
    " - We've noted that the elitism replacement method was killing the diversity within our population. This observation was done through the average fitness of each generation: with this value we were able to note that the average fitness was always equal to the best fit so far. So there was the need to wait for a mutation to insert some diversity in the population. Changing the the replacement method was helpfull to create diversity and improve the convergence rate."
