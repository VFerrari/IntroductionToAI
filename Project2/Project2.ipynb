    "The project consists of a study of genetic algorithm-based solutions for **image reconstruction**. A few set aspects of the problem will be explained, implemented and discussed here, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **modeling** of the problem as an evolutionary problem (chromosomes, genes, etc);\n",
    "- How to **generate the initial population**;\n",
    "- The chosen **fitness function**;\n",
    "- How to **visualize** the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with that, some aspects of the genetic algorithm will be tested and discussed with multiple approaches, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stop criteria;\n",
    "- Selection technique;\n",
    "- Crossover technique;\n",
    "- Mutation technique;\n",
    "- Generation replacement method.\n",

    "Also, the following **parameters** will be tested with multiple values as well:\n",
    "- Population size;\n",
    "- Mutation rate;\n",
    "- Crossover rate.\n",

    "## **Problem**\n",
    "### General Information\n",
    "The problem consists of, given an image, recreate it from scratch, using the original image only for fitness purposes, to check the similarity between our image and the original. This is not particularly useful in many applications, but can be used as basis for other problems, and is good for the purpose of this project: test different methods of reproduction, mutation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation came from [Roger Johansson's \"Evolution of Mona Lisa\"](https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/), but instead of using polygons, the pixel values are directly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling\n",
    "The modeling of the problem as a GA problem is almost direct: the image is the individual (chromosome) and each of its pixels is a gene. The image can be represented by a multitude of different ways. The chosen way of representation is as a flat array, as this allows for easier operations, especially crossover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "Due to the huge number of combinations in an image (255 possiblities per pixel), greyscale images are used in this project. Low-resolution images are best for this, but there are methods of reducing the resolution using _OpenCV_."

    "\n",
    "In order to merge all components of the code we created a class called GeneticAlgorithm. This class retains some essential variables for the methods defined along the report. To allow each method to access these variables, even though they are not a part of the class, nearly every method must receive as it's first parameter the class instance which is referred as the parameter 'self' in their definitions. It should also be noted that the method usualy have no return statements, simply because the 'self' parameter is a reference to the class instance, which allow the methods to make changes in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify which class variables are necessary and which are defined by the methods in each section, there will be a list of **used class variables** and **defined class variables** within the description of every section. On top of these uses and definitions, there are parameters which are method dependent, these are in the sections **necessary parameters**."

    "\n",
    "The algorithm cannot run forever. In this section will define a convergence method for halting the program's exection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence function must identify when the algorithm's improvement rate has significantly decreased or even stalled. To do so, it must know to some extent the rate of improvement per generation, which can be infered by the difficulty in improving the best individual found so far. Assume we have the best indivudual so far ($B$), therefore We can estimate when the algorithm is decreasing it's evolution rate (or improvement rate) by checking how many generations have passed since a better individual than $B$ was achieved: the more generations where $B$ wasnt improved, the more likely is has converged. The convergence method defined in this section is based on this idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Necessary parameters:**\n",
    " 1. *limit* - Suppose generation $X$ has the best individual so far, now assume we are at generation $Y$ and $Y>X$. This implies that the last $L=Y-X$ generation did not improve the fittest individual found so far. If $L>limit$ we consider that the algorithm has converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Used class variables:** \n",
    " 1. *self.all_fits* - Used to find the fittest individual of the new generation.\n",
    " 2. *self.best_fit* - Holds the fittness of the best individual across all generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defined class variables:**\n",
    " 1. *self.counter* - Counts generations since the last improvement of the best individual.\n",
    " 2. *self.best_genfit* - If theres a new better individual we must update this variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** even checking for convergence, the algorithm might still present sufficiently small improvements to avoid convergence, however, they might be so small that it will take a enormous amount of time to converge. As a failsafe to this scenario, we will limit the total amount of generations that can be created from withing the GeneticAlgorithm class."

    "\n",
    " - Uniform Crossover is extremely slow since it has to iterate through every gene (and there are a lot of genes) and randomize the possibility of gene exchange. Despite being a possible counter measure to premature convergence, it was simply to slow to use it.\n",
    " - Rergarding mutation rate and mutation ammount, in our case it appeared to be better when we would use the a higher probability of mutation with a smaller number of genes to mutate. The more genes we mutate, the slower is the iteration (as we need to roll the dice more times), so a higher change of mutation was a more efficient approach agains a higher number of genes to mutate.\n",
    " - Different sizes of populations did not seem to interfere significantly with the results, as expected a smaller population converges faster but it alsos converges prematurely most times."
