    "### Project\n",
    "The project consists of a study of genetic algorithm-based solutions for **image reconstruction**. A few set aspects of the problem will be explained, implemented and discussed here, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **modeling** of the problem as an evolutionary problem (chromosomes, genes, etc);\n",
    "- How to **generate the initial population**;\n",
    "- The chosen **fitness function**;\n",
    "- How to **visualize** the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with that, some aspects of the genetic algorithm will be tested and discussed with multiple approaches, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stop criteria;\n",
    "- Selection technique;\n",
    "- Crossover technique;\n",
    "- Mutation technique;\n",
    "- Generation replacement method.\n",

    "Also, the following **parameters** will be tested with multiple values as well:\n",
    "- Population size;\n",
    "- Mutation rate;\n",
    "- Crossover rate.\n",

    "## **Problem**\n",
    "### General Information\n",
    "The problem consists of, given an image, recreate it from scratch, using the original image only for fitness purposes, to check the similarity between our image and the original. This is not particularly useful in many applications, but can be used as basis for other problems, and is good for the purpose of this project: test different methods of reproduction, mutation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation came from [Roger Johansson's \"Evolution of Mona Lisa\"](https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/), but instead of using polygons, the pixel values are directly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling\n",
    "The modeling of the problem as a GA problem is almost direct: the image is the individual (chromosome) and each of its pixels is a gene. The image can be represented by a multitude of different ways. The chosen way of representation is as a flat array, as this allows for easier operations, especially crossover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "Due to the huge number of combinations in an image (255 possiblities per pixel), greyscale images are used in this project. Low-resolution images are best for this, but there are methods of reducing the resolution using _OpenCV_."

    "\n",
    "In order to merge all components of the code we created a class called GeneticAlgorithm. This class retains some essential variables for the methods defined along the report.

    "\n",
    "The first step to run a genetic algorithm is creating a population to serve as a starting point for the selection, reproduction and mutation process. This function also handles the initilization of the current best population, the best population overall fitness and best individual fitness, which are paramount for convergence check and final results.   \n",

    "The convergence function must identify when the algorithm's improvement rate has significantly decreased or even stalled. To do so, it must know the overall quality of the current population, which can be easily calculated with the sum of every indivudual's fitness score. Let's call this overall finess the generation fitness. We can estimate when the algorithm is decreasing it's evolution rate (or improvement rate) by checking how many generations have passed since the best generation so far was achieved: the more unimproved generations, the more likely is has converged. This is what the convergence method will do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** even checking for convergence, the algorithm might still present sufficiently small improvements to avoid convergence, however, they might be so small that it will take a enormous amount of time to converge. As a failsafe to this scenario, we will limit the total amount of generations that can be created from withing the GeneticAlgorithm class."
