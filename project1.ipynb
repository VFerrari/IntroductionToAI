    "Consider the Pacman video game. We're given a maze where each position can have one of the following: start (unique), goal (unique), enemy, dots, walls or empty spaces. The pacman will begin the game in the start position and will try to reached the goal position only crossing through empty spaces and dots positions. In the event were pacman reaches outside the map, it's position is \"wrapped around\" the map, meaning that it will appear on the oposite side of the map maintaining one of it's coodinates.\n",
    "When compared to the original game, some simplifications were made: \n",
    " - Ghosts do not move during the pacmans search (their initial position is their only position) \n",
    " - Berries were removed from the game, therefore Pacman has no countermeasure against ghosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Modeling**\n",
    " For every move pacman makes, it will pay a cost of 1 point, however, if a dot is found, it will receive a payment of 10 points. The sum of all costs and payments will be considered the score achieve by Pacman when executing a certain path. Also, Pacman can only move one position at a time. \n",
    "Based on such maze and restrictions, we must seek the best feasible path for Pacman to reach the goal. In our case, \"best\" refers to the path in which we achieve the highest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment:** Is the maze described by the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actuator:** The only action allowed to pacman is to move to a neighbor cel in the maze given the problems restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sensors:** We consider that pacman can \"see\" the entirety of the given maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Known:** The consquences to the environment given an action are completely predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment Properties:**\n",
    " - **Fully observable:** We can see the entire maze.\n",
    " - **Deterministic:** The next state is entirely defined by the current state an a possible action on it.\n",
    " - **Static:** The only change that occurs within the maze is cause by Pacman himself, the ghosts do not act.\n",
    " - **Single Agent:** The only agent within the problem is Pacman.\n",
    " - **Observability:** ??\n",
    " - **Sequential:** The state of the environment is completely predictable and is only affected by Pacman himself."

    "How fast the agent reaches the goal in A\\* depends on the heuristic implemented and how it affects the nodes expansion. Without the maze in state this isn't that much of a concern, as for a $n\\times m$ maze there can be up to $O(nm)$ states. It's pretty hard, though, to estimate a good cost to goal without the current configuration knowledge (the combinations of foods can make any estimation over the initial maze very far from optimal). To simplify, we use the **Manhattan distance** as a heuristic for this variation of the problem, which is the distance between the agent and the goal positions measured along axes at right angles (i.e., $|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$, given that the agent is in $(x_1, y_1)$ and the goal is to reach $(x_2, y_2)$). It's a admissible heuristic as there can't be a shorten path from node to goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "With maze in state it's specially important to pick a good heuristic - after all, the search space is exponentially large, as each subset of eaten food represents a different node even with the agent in a fixed position. Considering that in this case we have information that allows a more realistic approach, but keeping it simple in terms of code, we implement the sum of Manhattan distances between the agent and all the foods as a heuristic, as it's highly possible that most of them will be eaten in the optimal path. Notice that this sum can overestimate the optimal, because it's not always true that all the foods will be eaten in the best path. As a overestimating heuristic, it breaks admissibility - that is, A\\* is not guaranteed to find the optimal path. Even so, as our problem gives a high score to Pac-Man when it eats, we chose it expecting A\\* will find good paths in reasonable running times. \n"
